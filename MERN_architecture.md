A detailed technical architecture diagram illustrating the deployment of a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) API application using a CI/CD pipeline with GitLab CE. The diagram should include a GitLab CE server, where the source code is stored and managed, connected to a CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment processes. Show the integration of Prometheus for monitoring metrics and Grafana for visualizing these metrics, with both tools connected to the GitLab server and the deployed MERN application. Include nodes representing the MongoDB database, Express.js server, React frontend, and Node.js backend, all interconnected, and depict the flow of data and monitoring information between these components. Use clear labels and arrows to indicate the direction of data flow and interactions between each part of the architecture.
